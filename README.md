# NLP News Capsule

## Overview

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, staying informed by reading multiple news articles can be overwhelming and time-consuming. Text summarization leverages natural language processing (NLP) to condense lengthy articles into concise, digestible summaries, allowing users to quickly grasp the key points. This project aims to build an advanced news summarization tool that applies state-of-the-art NLP techniques to deliver accurate, readable summaries of news content efficiently.

The NLP News Capsule offers the following capabilities:

* **Extractive Summarization**: Identifies and extracts the most relevant sentences from a news article, creating a summary that directly reflects the original text.
* **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates concise summaries by paraphrasing and rephrasing content, producing natural and coherent summaries beyond mere extraction.
* **Customizable Summary Length**: Users can specify the desired summary length, enabling flexible control over the level of detail.
* **Multilingual Support**: Summarizes news articles in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese, broadening its usability across diverse audiences.
* **API Access**: Provides a RESTful API, allowing seamless integration of summarization features into external applications and workflows.
